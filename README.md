Data Wrangling II
Perform the following operations using Python on any open source dataset (eg. data.csv)
1. Scan all variables for missing values and inconsistencies. If there are missing values and/or 
inconsistencies, use any of the suitable techniques to deal with them. 
2. Scan all numeric variables for outliers. If there are outliers, use any of the suitable 
techniques to deal with them. 
3. Apply data transformations on at least one of the variables. The purpose of this 
transformation should be one of the following reasons: to change the scale for better 
understanding of the variable, to convert a non-linear relation into a linear one, or to 
decrease the skewness and convert the distribution into a normal distribution.

Basic Statistics - Measures of Central Tendencies and Variance
Perform the following operations on any open source dataset (eg. data.csv)
1. Provide summary statistics (mean, median, minimum, maximum, standard deviation) for 
a dataset (age, income etc.) with numeric variables grouped by one of the qualitative 
(categorical) variable. For example, if your categorical variable is age groups and 
quantitative variable is income, then provide summary statistics of income grouped by the 
age groups. Create a list that contains a numeric value for each response to the categorical 
variable. 
2. Write a Python program to display some basic statistical details like percentile, mean, 
standard deviation etc. of the species of ‘Iris-setosa’, ‘Iris-versicolor’ and ‘Iris-versicolor’ 
of iris.csv dataset.
